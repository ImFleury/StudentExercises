Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem: updated_timesheet_has_expected_values_when_retrieved

Expected output: 10

Actual output: 1

How did you fix this bug?
The updateTimesheet method did not update the billable column. Added "billable = ?" to the string sql and added
updatedTimesheet.isBillable() as the value for billable.

Bug 2

Test that demonstrates problem: getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project

Expected output: 3

Actual output: 2

How did you fix this bug?
Changed the WHERE in the String sql from "employee_id" to "project_id" so it searches the correct column.


Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem: getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee

Expected output: 2

Actual output: 1

How did you fix this bug?
Updated if (results.next()) {} to while (results.next()) {} so that each row returned will be added to the timesheets
list instead of adding only the first row.

Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem: getBillableHours_returns_correct_total

Expected output: 0.0

Actual output: 2.0

How did you fix this bug?
Updated the WHERE clause in the sql statement to include "AND billable = true" to ensure that the selected timesheets
are all billable.
